Hi there,

My name is Olivier Dusabimana. I am a software engineer with various interests.
From programming languages and compilers, distributed systems, data warehouse to front end UI development.

My first job in software industry was in a telecom company building SMS services.
After that, I went on to help build health care systems such as [openrbf](http://www.openrbf.org/),
[OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/), and [iDeliver](https://www.vecnacares.org/ideliver).
Currently, I work at Adobe on bringing Acrobat [PDF tools](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online.html) in the browser.

Outside of my day job, I also enjoy contributing to open source project.
My current interests are mostly around programming languages and developer tools. I helped
building the initial version of [rome.tools](https://rome.tools/) before it was re-written in Rust.

This blog is my brain dump on things related to software engineering as well as
other subjects of interests. Opinions expressed here are strictly my own and do not reflect opinions of
my former or current employer or any other affiliate.

Other than programming my current interests that I might write about include:
* Music - Specifically Rap. I find the lyrics and rhyming schemes of some artists
fascinating. I'll write more about this in the future
* Fitness - I've been lifting weight more or less regularly since 2015. I'll share
the lessons or even my workout plan some day :)
* Philosophy - [Cogito, ergo sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum).
It seems to me that one of the main benefits of maintaining a blog is being able to
share thoughts without being constrained by Twitter's 280 character limit.
