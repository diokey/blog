Hi there,

I am a software engineer with various interests. From programming languages and
compilers, distributed systems, data warehouse to front end UI development.

I did my Master's at Georgia Tech through their awesome [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) program.

This blog is my brain dump on everything related to software engineering as well as
other subjects of interests

Opinions expressed here are strictly my own and do not reflect opinions of
