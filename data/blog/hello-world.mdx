# Welcome to Dusome Blog

Welcome to my blog which will talk mostly about software engineering but 
occasionally other topics of interests. 

Hello world is probably the most clicke introduction by developers. 
Well... At least now you know who you're dealing with ðŸ˜€ 

I'll write mostly about programming stuff. I plan to start off writing about
programming languages and compiler implementation. I recently took at class at
Georgia Tech about [compilers](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-8803-o08-compilers-theory-and-practice) 
which I very much enjoyed. I'd like to start writing about it while it's still fresh in my mind.

In my many ways programming languages have many similarities with humans languages.  
They have a culture and a way of thinking often associated with them.
Familiarizing oneself with as many languages as possible, not only exposes you to those
different cultures, it can also shape your way of thinking.

It's one of the reason why I like try to familiarize with not just many languages as possible.

With human languages, I can hold a conversation in Kirundi, Swahili, French and English. 
I have some familiarity with Spanish and currently learning Mandarin - 
which is turning out to be a real challenge but I digress. 

With computer languages, I am familiar with:
* Web languages: JS, CSS, HTML, PHP
* OOP languages: Java, C++
* Procedural languages: C
* Query languages: SQL
* Functional languages: oCaml

I am currently learning rust and will also be blogging often about creating a new languages.

Other than nerdy computer stuff, other topics I might talk about other topics including but
not limited to:
* Music - I am a big fan of Rap genre.
* Fitness - Weight lifting, body building
* Economics - Investing, Stock market

## What does "Dusome" mean ?

Dusome (`/dusomÉ™/`) pronounced `du` as in `dude` and `some` as in `sommelier` 
means "Let's read" in Kirundi.

## How's this blog build?

I've been procrastinating to start a blog post for a very long time.
Every time I tried to start my blog, it'd often would end up in 
a classing yak shaving in which I spent way too much time on the blogging platform
and never got to the actual writing.

I told myself I wouldn't fall into that trap again, So, I just grabbed a ready
made [template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) 
which was ready to deploy it on vercel within minutes.

At the time of this writing I haven't even changed any layout of any styling 
and honestly, I don't plan to, unless there's a need to. I want to focus on 
writing, writing and writing!
