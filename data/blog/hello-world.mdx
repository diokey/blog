# Welcome to Dusome Blog

Welcome to my blog which will talk mostly about software engineering but 
occasionally other topics of interests. My interests vary from time to time,
so I am not even going to pretend that I know the list of subject I'll talk about.

Hello world is probably the most clique introduction to anything related to 
computer programming. Well... You've been warned 

## How's this blog build?

I've been procrastinating to start a blog post for a very long time.
Every time I tried to start my blog, I'd first try to build my blogging website
which often would end up in a classing yak shaving in which I wanted to build
my own site builder and actually never got to the actual writing.

I told myself I wouldn't fall into that trap again, So, I just grabbed a ready
made template ([thanks]()) and was ready to deploy it on vercel within minutes.

At the time of this writing I haven't even changed any layout of any styling 
and honestly, I don't plan to, unless there's a need to. I want to focus on 
writting, writting and writting!

## What does "Dusome" mean ?

Dusome (pronounced `d-u-s-o-me`) means "Let's read" in my native language - Kirundi
